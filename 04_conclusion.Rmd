# Conclusion {-}

We covered a wide variety of SQL processes you might need in setting up a database and querying data.  Did we cover everything you might need to know?  Of course not.  It's only a 3 hour workshop and SQL is a big language.  I highly encourage you to look at the resources below to learn more and expand your SQL skills.  I also welcome pull requests and submitting issues for typo fixes or ideas for additional content.
