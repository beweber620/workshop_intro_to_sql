# Concepts

## What is a Relational Database?

A **relational database** is a collection of tables (organized in rows and
columns of data) that are related to each other in some way. 

If you’ve worked in Microsoft Excel this would be the equivalent to sheets of
data. Or, if you have experience with R or Python programming languages, this
would be the equivalent to data frames. 

We'll go more in-depth on the *relational* part when we cover the workshop dataset!


## What is SQL?

SQL stands for **structured query language**. SQL is a programming language
that allows you to answer questions about the data in a database using a
standard set of commands. You can pronounce SQL as "ess cue ell" or "sequel".


### What kinds of questions can SQL answer?

If you already work with data, you probably think about answering specific
questions such as:

* How many of **X** or **Y** are there?
* What are the unique values of **X**?
* Which of **X**, **Y**, and **Z** that occurred in a given time period?

You can use SQL to answer these kinds of questions.


### The Basics of Writing SQL Code

Today we’ll learn about all the following common SQL commands and how they’re used together to view, filter, aggregate, and join data.  

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] ...
FROM ...
[WHERE ...]
    [ [INNER | LEFT] JOIN ...]
[GROUP BY ... [HAVING ...]]
[ORDER BY ...] 
[LIMIT ...];
```

> **NOTE**:
> 
> - Commands in brackets "[ ]" are optional
> - Write commands in the order of the blueprint
> - End queries with a semicolon ";"


## What is a Relational Database Management System?

A **relational database management system** (RDBMS) is a software system that
manages the users of and tables within a database. There are many different
systems available. For instance, you may have heard of MySQL, Postgres, and
Microsoft SQL Server.

For this workshop, we'll use [SQLite][sqlite], which is likely the simplest and
most widely-used RDBMS. It runs on Windows, MacOS X, and Linux with no setup
necessary!

Every RDBMS has its own implementation or "dialect" of SQL. In other words, the
set of SQL commands supported differs from one RDBMS to another, and sometimes
queries have to be written differently. Details about the supported commands
for a given RDBMS can be found in that system's documentation. The commands
covered in this workshop are supported by almost all popular systems.


## Advantages & Disadvantages of SQL

SQL queries are **declarative**: you describe the data that you want. Then it's
up to SQL to determine the most efficient way to get that data. This approach
to programming has several advantages:

* You can work with very large data sets. Databases are typically stored on
  your computer's hard disk, and only the results from queries need to fit in
  memory (and there are ways to work around even this limitation).
* Queries are relatively fast compared to other data programming tools (such as
  R or Python). This is because the database system is free to choose the most
  efficient way to run the query.
* Queries are reproducible. You can save, edit, and run queries at a later
  date.
* SQL is less expressive and flexible than other data programming tools, so
  there are not too many different commands to remember.

SQL also has a few disadvantages:

* SQL is less expressive and flexible than other data programming tools. For
  instance, you can't use SQL to make a plot.
* Each RDBMS has its own dialect of SQL, so each time you work with a new
  database, you must familiarize yourself with which commands are supported.
* Setting up most database systems (other than SQLite) is a relatively
  complicated process.

* You can manage multiple data sources
  - With an RDBMS, you have access to more than one database
