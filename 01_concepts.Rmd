# Concepts

## What is SQL?
SQL, also pronounced "sequel," stands for "structured query language." It's a database programming language that allows you to answer questions about a database using a standard set of commands. 

### The SQL Query Blueprint

Today we’ll learn about all the following SQL commands and how they’re used together to view, filter, aggregate, and join data.  

```
SELECT [DISTINCT] ...
FROM ...
[WHERE ...]
    [ [INNER | LEFT] JOIN ...]
[GROUP BY ... [HAVING ...]]
[ORDER BY ...] 
[LIMIT ...];
```

> **NOTE**:
> 
> - Commands in brackets "[ ]" are optional
> - Write commands in the order of the blueprint
> - End queries with a semicolon ";"

## What is a Relational Database?

A relational database is a collection of tables (organized in rows and columns of data) that are related to each other in some way. 

If you’ve worked in Excel this would be the equivalent to sheets of data. Or, if you have experience with R or Python programming languages, this would be the equivalent to data frames. 

We'll go more in-depth when we cover the workshop data set!

## What is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)?

A RDBMS is a software that interacts with databases, users, and other applications. For the workshop we’ll be working with [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/index.html). It's a portable RDBMS that runs on Windows, MacOS, and Linux with no complex setup! 

Other popular RDBMS's include MySQL, Postgres, and Microsoft SQL Server, but it's an in-depth process to properly set up.

Every RDBMS has it's own implementation or "dialect" of SQL. For SQLite there's sqlite3, but everything we learn will be applicable to other popular RDBMS!


## Why do you want to learn to work with databases and SQL?

* Efficiency
  + Write a few lines of code rather than lots of manual data manipulation
  + SQL is meant for data manipulation
* Reproducibility 
  + Save queries as a record of your workflow
  + Re-run code with updates
* Work with large amounts of data
  + Typically faster to run a process in a database than in a spreadsheet
  + Store lots of data (compare with Excel's row limits)
* Data management
  + One database file stores many, many tables which is represented as one file in your file browser
  + Write a query instead of making a new files or tabs
    
### You're Already Doing This!

If you work with data, you're typically already thinking about answering questions:

- I would like to see ***XYZ*** that occurred in a certain time range.
- How many of ***X*** or ***Y*** are there?
- What unique values of ***X*** exist?
