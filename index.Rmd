# Overview {-}

This workshop teaches the basics of (non-spatial) SQL using DB Browsesr and SQLite. This workshop provides an overview of the utility and base SQL commands for working with data in a relational database. Weâ€™ll focus on querying data to get to know a database and answer questions, and combining data from separate tables.

__Goals__  
After this workshop learners should be able to:

- Perform common SQL commands including sorting, filtering, calculating values, aggregating, combining data, and basic data cleaning (i.e. replace missing values).
- Combine commands to construct a query to answer a specific question.
- Identify the benefits of working with SQL.
- Access additional resources for using SQL in other software like R.

__Prerequisites__  
No prior programming experience is necessary. Bring your laptop with DB Browser 
installed (https://sqlitebrowser.org/) and running.
