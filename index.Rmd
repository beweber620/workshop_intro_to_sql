# Overview {-}

This workshop teaches the basics of SQL using SQLite and SQLiteStudio. This workshop provides an overview of the utility and base SQL commands for working with data in a relational database. Weâ€™ll focus on querying data to get to know a database and answer questions, and joining data from separate tables.

__Goals__  
After this workshop learners should be able to:

- Perform common SQL commands including viewing, filtering, aggregating, and joining data.
- Combine commands to construct a query to answer a specific question.
- Identify the benefits of working with SQL.
- Access additional resources for using SQL in other software like R.

__Prerequisites__  
No prior programming experience is necessary: 

- Have [SQLiteStudio](https://sqlitestudio.pl/) installed on your computer and running. View the install guide [here](https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/install_guides/sql-and-database-tools.html#sqlitestudio).
- Download the workshop materials from the Google Drive link [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/19XAjvRScly5yRLcvhcHWJq577VlSm6DP/view?usp=sharing). Make sure to unzip the folder and keep track of where it's saved. There will be 2 files:
